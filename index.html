                Hello! My name is Denis, and I’m a 16-year-old aspiring full-stack engineer based in Bacău, Romania. Ever since I discovered programming, I’ve been fascinated by the endless possibilities that come with building technology. I’m currently focused on mastering the fundamentals of web development, including HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, while also beginning to explore back-end technologies and the broader world of full-stack engineering.
            </p>
            <p>
                I spend most of my time learning, building small projects, and experimenting with new ideas. I believe that hands-on experience is one of the best ways to grow as a developer, and I’m committed to improving every day. My long-term goal is to become a full-stack developer and work in New York City, where I hope to contribute to innovative tech solutions and be part of a dynamic development community.
            </p>
            <p>
                This is my very first project, and it represents the start of a journey I’m incredibly excited about. I know the road ahead will be challenging, but I’m ready to push my limits and keep moving forward—one line of code at a time.
